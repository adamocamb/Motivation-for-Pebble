# Motivation-for-Pebble
A motivational quote app for the Pebble smartwatch. This project is on hold for the time being, but I do plan on coming back to this when I have time!

### Quick Background
I started this as part of the second Pebble Hackathon. I gave myself 2 weeks to learn as much as I could about C and try to develop a simple app to retrieve and display motivational quotes. In those weeks I read through an [excellent book about C development for Pebble]([url](https://pebble.gitbooks.io/learning-c-with-pebble/content/)) and learned a ton about the Pebble development environment, virtual machines, and communicating with an API using C. Unfortunately I ran out of time to finish by the deadline.
